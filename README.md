# Predicting-Covid-19-protein-protein-interactions 
## Building a complete site that is used to predict whether a protein sample will bind to the covid-19 proteins or not using ML & DL 

* In this project, an ML and DL were proposed to predict the interactions of non-structural proteins belonging to COVID-19 with other human proteins 
* data collected from the BioGrid dataset. 
>  In phase 1 
* we mapped the data using a protein analysis package called (BioPython) which  apply a non physiochemical feature extraction.The data has been normalized using the z-score method then the data has been classified using a random forest classifier which gave us a 99.33% accuracy ,98.2% with SVM classifier and 87.8% with Logistic Regression classifier . 
> In phase 2 
* we mapped the data using AVL tree method which is a computational method.Proteins sequences represented as a numeric representation according to each amino acid depth in AVL.Then these sequence classified by RNN  (BiRNN) which get a 99.58% accuracy an this is a great for an algorithm-based mapping method.
* Compared to experimental methods computational methods are time efficient and can analyze the protein interactions with less equipment. Furthermore, with the recent development of technology protein sequence information can be obtained easily.
